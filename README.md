# Nova chain

## 📌 Project Description
Nova chain is a simple blockchain-based system designed to demonstrate core smart contract behaviors including user registration and public announcement posting. It provides a foundational structure for decentralized communication or identity-driven applications.

## 🚀 Project Vision
To evolve Nova chain into a modular and extendable communication layer for decentralized systems—enabling identity management, on-chain updates, and transparent event-driven interactions.

## ⭐ Key Features
- **User Registration:** Users can register once to participate.
- **Announcement Messaging:** Registered users can post or update a shared public announcement.
- **Ownership Controls:** The contract owner can reset the announcement when needed.
- **Event Logging:** All major actions are recorded on-chain.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Role-based access permissions (admin/moderator system)  
- Multi-message storage with timestamps  
- Integration with decentralized identity (DID) systems  
- A React-based dApp UI with wallet support  
- On-chain reputation tracking for registered users  
- Token or NFT rewards for active participants
